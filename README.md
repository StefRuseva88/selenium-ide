### This is a test project for Front-End Test Automation July 2024 Course @ SoftUni

This project demonstrates my skills in using Selenium IDE, a record-and-playback tool, to quickly create and execute UI tests without needing to write code manually. Selenium IDE allows for easy test case creation and provides a way to export these tests into different programming languages if further customization is required.

### Key Features:
- Creating automated tests through recording user interactions with the browser.
- Exporting test scripts in different formats, such as C# with WebDriver code.
- Running automated tests directly from the browser to quickly verify web functionalities.
- Integrating with GitHub Actions for continuous testing and reporting.
