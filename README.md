This project demonstrates my skills in using Selenium IDE, a record-and-playback tool, to quickly create and execute UI tests without needing to write code manually. Selenium IDE allows for easy test case creation and provides a way to export these tests into different programming languages if further customization is required.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Selenium IDE for creating and managing test scripts.
- Chrome or Firefox with Selenium IDE installed for browser compatibility.
- Developer Tools: Use for copying text assertions and debugging.

### Running Tests
To run these tests, import the scripts into Selenium IDE and execute. Tests are organized by functionality, allowing targeted validation.

### Notes
- Adjust Chrome security settings for smooth testing when using hardcoded credentials.
- For Firefox, the Google Password Manager interference is minimized.

## Additional Resources
- [Selenium IDE Commands Reference](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands)
- [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/)

This suite is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating comprehensive test coverage on popular demo applications and practical Selenium techniques.
